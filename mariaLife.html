    <section class="Scientist">
            <h2>Scientist</h2>
            <p>Maria Montessori attended the University of Rome in 1896, where she majored in medicine, becoming one of the first women in Italy to do so. This challenging journey highlighted her scientific mind and resilience. She excelled in mastering scientific principles, practicing medicine, and conducting research. These skills became the foundation for her later work in education.</p>
            <p>During her time as the assistant director of a psychiatric clinic, Montessori noticed that children with intellectual disabilities were often neglected and dismissed as hopeless by society. Determined to make a difference, she applied her scientific background to observe and analyze the children’s needs. She designed innovative educational methods, incorporating hands-on materials and fostering independence. Her scientific approach laid the groundwork for her revolutionary educational philosophy</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Reformer">
            <h2>Reformer</h2>
            <p>While working in the psychiatric clinic, Maria Montessori realized that the children, often labeled as "dumb" or "worthless" by society, were capable of much more than anyone had imagined. Her observations led her to challenge traditional education systems. She developed teaching methods that respected the individuality of each child and nurtured their potential.</p>
            <p>Her reforms began with children who were marginalized and extended to the broader education system. Montessori’s emphasis on child-led learning and respect for the student’s autonomy revolutionized the way education was viewed, paving the way for her to become a global advocate for change.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCA7nngTVp4" target="_blank">Here</a> is a great video that goes in-depth about what Maria did as a reformer and her history.</p>

    <section class="Peacemaker">
        <h2>Peacemaker</h2>
        <p>Maria Montessori believed that education was key to achieving world peace. She envisioned schools as environments where children could learn not only academic skills but also empathy, collaboration, and respect for others. In her lectures and writings, she emphasized that children were the builders of a peaceful future. Montessori schools reflect these ideals by fostering a sense of community and global citizenship. Her efforts earned her two nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, underscoring her influence as a peacemaker.</p>
        <p></p>
    </section>
    <section class="Visionary">
        <h2>Visionary</h2>
        <p>Montessori’s ability to see beyond the norms of her time defined her as a true visionary. She believed that education should not be about rote memorization but about nurturing the whole child—intellectually, socially, emotionally, and spiritually. Her concept of “following the child” revolutionized the role of the teacher, shifting from authority figures to guides who facilitate learning. Montessori’s ideas remain relevant and continue to inspire educators worldwide.</p>
        <p>Maria Montessori achieved remarkable milestones in her lifetime. She not only transformed the field of education but also ensured that children, regardless of their economic status, had access to a quality education. Her first school, Casa dei Bambini, was established in an extremely poor area, demonstrating her commitment to serving underprivileged communities. This philosophy has since grown exponentially, influencing educational systems across the globe.</p>

        <p>To learn more, you can watch a YouTube video by her great-granddaughter click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQy4k1wcAJ0"  target="_blank"> here </a></p>
        <p>Maria Montessori was, in my opinion, a woman ahead of her time. She saw the child as a whole person, not merely as a means to an end or a way to make a machine function. She recognized that each child is unique and intelligent in their own way. In The Montessori Way, there's a powerful quote that encapsulates this belief: <em>"All children are uniquely intelligent."</em> (Seldin & Epstein, 2003, p. 17). This quote highlights her conviction that every child possesses their own form of intelligence, and it should be nurtured and respected.</p>

    <section class="Feminist">
        <h2>Feminist</h2>
        <p>Maria Montessori broke barriers as a trailblazing feminist. As the first woman admitted to the University of Rome's medical program, she faced immense opposition. She required a letter of recommendation from the Pope to gain entry and endured harsh treatment from her male peers. They refused to let her sit with them in class or work with cadavers during regular hours, forcing her to conduct dissections alone at night.
        </p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, Montessori persevered and graduated with her medical degree. Her success defied societal expectations and proved that women could excel in fields dominated by men. Throughout her life, she advocated for gender equality and demonstrated the power of determination and resilience.</p>
        <p>Montessori’s commitment to empowering future generations is reflected in her words:
           <em>"We are the sowers—our children are those who reap. We labor so that future generations will be better and nobler than we are."</em> (The Absorbent Mind, Chapter 1)</p>
        <p>This quote highlights her belief in the transformative role of women in shaping a better society. By breaking barriers in her own life and dedicating herself to the education of all children—regardless of their social or economic background—Montessori embodied feminist ideals. She proved that women’s contributions to science, education, and society could create lasting change for generations to come.</p>
