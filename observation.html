        <h2>Purpose and role of Observation</h2>
        <p>Observation plays a central role in Montessori education. It is used to understand where each child is developmentally, what interests them, and what they are ready to explore next. Rather than focusing on right or wrong answers, observation helps guide the teacher to see the whole child, including their learning style, emotional state, and individual needs.</p>
        <p>Through observation, the teacher can decide when to present a new lesson, when to allow space for independent work, and when changes might be needed in the classroom environment. A child deeply engaged in a material may be in a sensitive period and benefit from uninterrupted time. A child who is restless or unsure may need a new challenge or quiet support. Observation keeps the classroom responsive and balanced.</p>
        <p>The teacher’s role is to remain calm, present, and attentive. By quietly observing and recording without interfering, the teacher gains insight that supports each child’s natural development. This process makes it possible to follow the child with purpose and to create learning experiences that build independence, focus, and a love of learning.</p>

        <h2>Process of Observation</h2>
        <p>Observation can be done in a detailed and organized way. This helps guide teaching and classroom management so that every child’s needs are met. One effective method for observing is called CORE, which stands for Child, Objective, Role of the adult, and Environment. Using CORE helps keep the observation focused and useful.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Process of Observation in Montessori Education</strong></p>
        <p>Preparation: The teacher enters the classroom calmly and neutrally. Tools like a clipboard or observation notebook are used to quietly record notes. The goal is to be present without interfering or distracting the children.</p>
        <p>Silent Watching: A child or small group is chosen to watch quietly. During this time, the teacher avoids interrupting, correcting, or helping unless absolutely needed. This allows the child to behave naturally and show real interests.</p>
        <p><strong>Recording Observations: Notes are taken using the CORE framework:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Child: Focus on what the child is doing, how they use materials, and their interactions with others.</li>
            <li>Objective: Consider the learning goal or developmental skill that might be involved.</li>
            <li>Role of the Adult: Note how the teacher is supporting, guiding, or stepping back during the activity.</li>
            <li>Environment: Observe how the classroom setup, materials, and atmosphere influence the child’s work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Details like how long the child stays focused, their problem-solving methods, language use, social behavior, and independence are carefully recorded.</p>
        <p>Reflecting and Analyzing: After observing, notes are reviewed to find patterns and understand the child’s needs. This helps determine if the child is ready for new lessons, if interests have shifted, or if the classroom environment needs adjustment.</p>
        <p>Taking Action: Based on these insights, materials may be rotated, lessons offered, groupings changed, or the classroom layout adjusted. These steps help support each child’s unique development.</p>
